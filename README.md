## Overview
Road to BAA Mastery transforms the Business Achievements Awards Program into a fun and interactive role-playing journey the player undertakes to reach a final goal: the BAA Awards. The player starts on a map where two FBLA elders guide his/her path through the four major levels and minigames: Progress, Service, Education, and Mastery. Completing each level provides the player with an accomplishment token they must have in order to progress through the game. Throughout these levels we integrated lives, tokens, penalties, interactive battles, quizzes, and game progression. By creating a role-playing game we wanted the player to understand the best actions to take and apply the BAA program skills in the real world. Once the player finishes the game they are presented with a pin at the end-game Awards Ceremony just like real FBLA.
The user interface and instructions are identified when the gameplay starts in order to minimize player confusion.
